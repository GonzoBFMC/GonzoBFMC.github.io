  <h1>Freedom</h1>
  <hr>
        <p>Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose.<br>
      --Janis Joplin</p>
  <hr>
    <p>The chains that keep us from true freedom are bad experierces of the past,<br>
      good experiences of the past, fear and anxieties about the future, ambitions<br>
      for the future, clinging to present things, and delusions about our own<br>
      importance.<br>
      --Anthony Demello</p>
  <hr>
    <p>Freedom is a illusion and if you think that you are free than just means that you are truely trapped.<br>
      The thing that you should be thinking about is what do you control and how much of control you truely have?<br>
      Any people will say they control thier body, but you height the color of you eyes are some examples that you can not control.<br>
