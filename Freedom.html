  <h1>Freedom</h1>
  <hr>
    <p>Freedom is just another wod for nothong left to lose.<br>
      --Janis Joplin</p>
  <hr>
    <p>The chains that keep us from true freedom are bad experierces of the past,<br>
      good experiences of the past, fear and anxieties about the future, ambitions<br>
      for the future, clinging to present things, and delusions about our own<br>
      importance.<br>
      --Anthony Demello</p>
  <hr>
    <p>Freedom is a illusion that you think that you own but in reality I own you!<br>
    Larry Thomas</p>
    <hr>
    The thought that you think you own your thoughts and mind is a misunderstanding on your part. The truth of the matter is that you belong to me.</p>
